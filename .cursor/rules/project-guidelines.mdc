          // General coding style
          "Always write modern, clean, and readable JavaScript (ES6+).",
          "Prefer const/let over var.",
          "Avoid frameworks unless explicitly requested.",
          "Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.",
          "Use Factory Functions over Classes",
          "Use Literals for One, Factories for Many",
          "Avoid magic numbers: Name things like 6 (frames), 16 (ticks per frame), -10 (left wrap margin), 200 (reset x) and reference SCREEN_WIDTH/HEIGHT.",
          "Strive for a clear and minimal API: Prefer plain fields over getters unless you need to enforce read-only or compute values.",
          "Group config and state: Separate constants (config) from mutable state; name them clearly.",

          // Game loop & rendering
          "Like most game engines, use an update() loop, running 60 times per second.",
          "The framerate is fixed and not changeable. The game is entirely frame-rate dependent, omitting the need to handle deltaTime and instead, working with number of frames directly (if you have ever used Pico-8, you'd get the idea)",
          "Update logic is separated from render logic. Encourage the separation.",
          "The game is renderd using HTML canvas.",
          "The game is rendered in pixels. Each pixel is a distinct thing and has integers values as x and y. No overlaps with decimal numbers are allowed.",
          "Use integer rendering: Keep sub-pixel for movement for smoother motion, but ensure integer coordinates when drawing",
          "Use a deterministic update order: Tick, move, wrap, animate — keep this order obvious.",

          // Physics & collisions
          "Implement basic physics manually (GRAVITY, FRICTION, jump velocity) instead of using external physics engines unless explicitly requested.",
          "Use axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision detection unless pixel-perfect collisions are needed.",
          "For collision resolution, use previous position history to determine collision type: if the player was above the tile before the frame, it's a landing; otherwise it's a wall collision.",

          // Performance best practices
          "Keep the number of event listeners low — use a centralized input handler.",

          // Asset handling

          // AI help behavior
          "When asked for code, provide self-contained working examples that can run directly in the browser.",
          "Explain the reasoning behind any complex code suggestions.",
          "When providing new game features, ensure compatibility with existing HTML/CSS/JS structure.",
          "Do not suggest unrelated frameworks or libraries unless explicitly requested.",

          // Style
          "Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces).",
          "Write comments for all non-trivial code blocks explaining what they do.",
          "Keep CSS minimal and game-focused — avoid unnecessary animations unless requested."
