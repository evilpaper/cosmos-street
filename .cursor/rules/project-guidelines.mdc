          // General coding style
          "Always write modern, clean, and readable JavaScript (ES6+).",
          "Prefer const/let over var.",
          "Avoid frameworks unless explicitly requested.",
          "Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.",
          "Use Factory Functions over Classes",

          // Game loop & rendering
          "Like most game engines, use an update() loop, running 60 times per second.",
          "The framerate is fixed and not changeable. The game is entirely frame-rate dependent, omitting the need to handle deltaTime and instead, working with number of frames directly (if you have ever used Pico-8, you'd get the idea)",
          "Encourage separating update logic from render logic.",
          "The game is renderd in canvas.",

          // Physics & collisions
          "Implement basic physics manually (gravity, friction, jump velocity) instead of using external physics engines unless explicitly requested.",
          "Use axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collision detection unless pixel-perfect collisions are needed.",

          // Performance best practices
          "Minimize unnecessary DOM manipulation during gameplay.",
          "Batch draw calls where possible.",
          "Keep the number of event listeners low — use a centralized input handler.",
          "Avoid memory leaks by cleaning up references when removing objects.",

          // Asset handling
          "Load images, audio, and other assets asynchronously and provide loading feedback.",
          "Cache assets to avoid reloading during gameplay.",

          // AI help behavior
          "When asked for code, provide self-contained working examples that can run directly in the browser.",
          "Explain the reasoning behind any complex code suggestions.",
          "When providing new game features, ensure compatibility with existing HTML/CSS/JS structure.",
          "Do not suggest unrelated frameworks or libraries unless explicitly requested.",

          // Style
          "Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces).",
          "Write comments for all non-trivial code blocks explaining what they do.",
          "Keep CSS minimal and game-focused — avoid unnecessary animations unless requested."
