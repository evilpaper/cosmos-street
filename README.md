## About this project

Cosmos Street is an old-school auto-runner, heavily inspired by the skateboard sequences from Wonder Boy on the Sega Master System. It is made for fun, and as an experiment in exploring the creative limits of traditional video games.

The game runs right in your browser, built with just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no frameworks, no build tools, nothing fancy. Just simple, direct, classic game development.

## How to play

Jump = Arrow Up
Slow down = Arrow Left
Speed up = Arrow Right

The game restart automatically when the player fall off the screen.

That's it!
