> **Warning**
> This game is a work in progress. I'm building this in public.
> See the roadmap below.

## About this project

This project as a hackable auto runner video game. Playable in the browser. Made for fun and an urge to explore pixel art, interactivity and traditional video games limitations. Kept as plain and close to the platform as possible. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step or things like that.

## How to play

Jump = Arrow Up
Slow down = Arrow Left
Speed up = Arrow Right

The game restart automatically when the player fall off the screen.

Tips: You can edit the level in the level object if you run the game locally. The level is just an JavaScript array.

That's it!

## Features

- CSS Clip Path to get the shape of the screen
- CRT/Scanline effect with CSS Keyframes
- Mini traditional video Game Engine with Update and Draw methods

## Roadmap

- [ ] Ending
- [ ] Touch controls
- [ ] Level editor
- [ ] Highscore

## Running Locally

No need to install anything. Just open index.html in your web browser of choice and game along.

If you have cloned the repo you can run it from your shell with the open command, something like this:

```sh
open -a "Google Chrome" index.html
```
