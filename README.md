## About this project

This project as an hackable auto runner in the browser. Playing around with pixel art, traditional video games etc. I wanted to keep this as plain as possible. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step etc.

## How to play

Jump = Arrow Up
Slow down = Arrow Left
Speed up = Arrow Right

The game restart automatically when the player fall off the screen.

Tips: You can edit the level in the level object if you run the game locally. The level is just an JavaScript array.

That's it!

open -a "Google Chrome" index.html
```
